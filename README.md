### Title: 
Application of Huffman coding on text file by Obaid Ur Rehman Ansari
### Description:
Huffman codes are lossless data compression codes. Huffman codes are used for data communications, audio coding, and for image and video compression.
This code is written in python and gives the output of huffman coding by creating a compressed version of the input text file named 'sampletext'. The code also utilizes the compressed .bin file to decompress and retrieve the file in the original format and size.

To view the binary file content in hexadecimal format use the website https://hexed.it/ to open the sampletext.bin file. 

The hexadecimal result of the current sampletext file is:

#### Technologies used:
Python 3
#### Run the program:
Run the file huffmantext.py in a compiler or type the command python huffmantext.py in the terminal. The file named huffman.py contains all the classes and functions required for Huffman coding of the text file which are called in the main huffmantext.py file.
